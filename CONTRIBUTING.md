* Install [nodejs](http://nodejs.org)

* `$ npm install`.
* `$ npm run-script build` to build the coffee-script.
* `$ npm run-script watch` to watch and build the coffee-script.
* `$ npm run-script publish` to release a new version.
* `$ npm run-script clean` to remove the build coffee-script files.
